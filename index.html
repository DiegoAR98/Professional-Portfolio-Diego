        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I have harbored a passion for technology ever since I was a child. At the tender age of seven, I began assisting my uncle at his LAN gaming center, setting up computers and configuring networks. By fifteen, I had secured my first position in IT as an entry-level computer technician. Immensely driven by this newfound profession, I pursued courses that covered the essentials, from mastering office products to computer repair.</p>
        <p>Years later, at 24, I returned to the IT sector in Florida. My role as an IT Repair Technician focused on laptop repairs. However, it was around this time that I stumbled upon coding. While initially daunting, my determination prevailed, leading me to embrace and eventually fall in love with coding. Today, I stand before you with my very first portfolio, a testament to my commitment and dedication. One assurance I can provide is that every project I undertake is infused with 100% effort and passion.</p>
